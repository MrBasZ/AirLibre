## AirLibre: A UBNT Python API For The Masses

The goal of AirLibre is to give Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) users a way of managing their devices without being relient on UBNT's software.

### No GUI; Not for the Faint of Heart
This was by design so configuration changes can be as flexible as Python itself. If you want to build a GUI for it, I'm more than happy to cheer you on with pom poms!

### What It Is and What It Isn't
AirLibre is not a standalone program you can use to manage devices, it is an API (Application Programming Interface). Its purpose is to make working with UBNT radios and routers like working with any other kind of data.

## License
The software uses the Apache License (V.2) as described in LICENSE.txt.

## Disclaimer
I am not associated with UBNT in any form except or being a user and a community member. Cleartivly, UBNT is not responsible for this code, if you feel like you need to express your opinion about this software, please do so to me, not to them.

__TL;DR: I don't get paid for working on this this code!__
